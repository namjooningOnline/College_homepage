# College_homepage
This was a recreation of a college website using only HTML and CSS. 
I presented this following the HTML and CSS portion of a fullstack bootcamp.
I wanted to practice using grid and other CSS properties.
I also wanted the website to be responsive using media queries. 

update: 
I wanted to add some JavaScript to this project, so I added a simple scroll-to-top button.
